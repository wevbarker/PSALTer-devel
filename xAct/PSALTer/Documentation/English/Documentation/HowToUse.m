Subsection@"How to use this documentation";
Comment@"Welcome to the calibration file for the PSALTer package. Commentary is provided in this green text throughout by virtue of the xPlain package.";
DisplayExpression@"xPlain also allows you to format numbered equations.";
Supercomment@"Occasionally, more important points will be highlighted in boxes like this.";
Comment@"Note that the xPlain package is not part of PSALTer, nor is it a dependency of PSALTer. However, to run the whole of this documentation notebook from the source (i.e. the accompanying Wolfram Language files), you will need to install xPlain. There is only one line of input code in this notebook, right at the top: this line calls the Wolfram Language files.";
Comment@"You don't need to run the line of code at the top to use this documentation. All the important samples of code are presented like this:";
Code[
	Print@"Hello world.";
];
Comment@"Don't be fooled: that looks like an input cell, but it is actually an output from the documentation source. You should however be able to execute cells like this, or copy the code into your own notebooks.";

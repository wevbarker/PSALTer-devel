# Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian (_PSALTer_)
## Version 1.0.0

- Initial release to accompany pre-print and documentation.

## About

_PSALTer_ is a software package for _Mathematica_ designed to predict the propagating quantum particle states in any tensorial field theory, including (but not limited to) just about any theory of gravity. The free action $S$ must have the structure
```math
S=\int\mathrm{d}^4x\ \zeta(x)^{\text{T}}\cdot\Big[\mathcal{O}(\partial)\cdot\zeta(x)-j(x)\Big],
```
where the ingredients are:
- The dynamical fields $\zeta(x)$ are real tensors, which may be a collection of distinct fields, each field having some collection of spacetime indices ($\mu$, $\nu$, etc.), perhaps with some symmetry among the indices. 
- The wave operator $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$ is a real, second-order (Ostrogradsky's theorem discourages higher-derivative operators, but even if it did not we note that the apparent order may always be lowered by the introduction of extra fields) differential operator constructed from the flat-space metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ and partial derivative $\partial_\mu$ (but _not_ the totally antisymmetric $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\sigma\lambda}$ tensor), linearly parameterised by a collection of coupling coefficients.
- The source currents $j(x)$ are conjugate to the fields $\zeta(x)$. They encode all external interactions to second order in fields, whilst keeping the external dynamics completely anonymous.

## Example: massive gravity 

As a demonstration, we consider the Fierz-Pauli linearised massive gravity theory
```math
S=\int\mathrm{d}^4x\ \Big[\alpha\big(-\partial^\mu h_{\mu\nu}\partial^nu h+\tfrac{1}{2}\partial_\mu h\partial^\mu h-\tfrac{1}{2}\partial_\sigma h^{\mu\nu}\partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu}+\partial_\nu h^{\mu\nu}\partial^\sigma h_{\mu\sigma}\big)+\beta\big(h^{\mu\nu}h_{\mu\nu}-h^2\big)+h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}\Big],
```
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coupling coefficients, $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric perturbation and $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the linearised stress-energy tensor of matter, which is the source conjugate to $h_{\mu\nu}$.

In a fresh notebook we first load the package:
```
<<xAct`PSALTer`;
```
Next, we define Lagrangian couplings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as `Coupling1` and `Coupling2` using the command `DefConstantSymbol` from _xAct_:
```mathematica
DefConstantSymbol[Coupling1,PrintAs->"\[Alpha]"];
DefConstantSymbol[Coupling2,PrintAs->"\[Beta]"];
```
Next, we use the command `DefField` from _PSALTer_ to define the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ as the symmetric, rank-two tensor field `LinearMetric`:
```mathematica
DefField[
    LinearMetric[-a,-b],
    Symmetric[{-a,-b}],
    PrintAs->"\[ScriptH]",
    PrintSourceAs->"\[ScriptCapitalT]"
];
```
The output should look like:

To compute the spectrum, we plug the Lagrangian into the `ParticleSpectrum` function from _PSALTer_:
```mathematica
ParticleSpectrum[
    Coupling1*(
	(1/2)*CD[-b]@LinearMetric[a,-a]*CD[b]@LinearMetric[c,-c]
	-CD[a]@LinearMetric[-a,-b]*CD[b]@LinearMetric[c,-c]
	-(1/2)*CD[-c]@LinearMetric[a,b]*CD[c]@LinearMetric[-a,-b]
	+CD[-b]@LinearMetric[a,b]*CD[c]@LinearMetric[-a,-c]
    )+Coupling2*(
    LinearMetric[-a,-b]*LinearMetric[a,b]
    -LinearMetric[a,-a]*LinearMetric[b,-b]), 
    TheoryName->"MassiveGravity",	
    Method->"Easy",
    MaxLaurentDepth->3
];
```
The output should look like:

## General use 

### Pre-defined geometry

When you first run `` <<xAct`PSALTer` `` the software defines a Minkowski manifold with the ingredients:

|Wolfram Language|Output format|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`a`, `b`, `c`, ..., `z`|$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, ... $\zeta$|Cartesian coordinate indices|
|`G[-m,-n]`|$\eta_{\mu\nu}$|Minkowski metric|
|`CD[-m]@`|$\partial_{\mu}$|Partial derivative|

### Provided functions 

_PSALTer_ defines _two_ functions. To define a tensor field you use `DefField`, which has a very similar syntax to `DefTensor` in _xTensor_:
```mathematica
DefField[
    FieldName_[Inds___],
    Symm_,
    PrintAs->PrintAsValue_?String,
    PrintSourceAs->PrintSourceAsValue_?String
];
```
The arguments and options are as follows:
- `FieldName` is the symbolic name of the new field.
- `Inds` are the indices of `FieldName`, if any.
- `Symm` is the intended index-symmetry on `Inds`. The syntax is the same as in `DefTensor`.
- `PrintAsValue` is the string that `FieldName` will format as. The syntax is the same as in `DefTensor`.
- `PrintSourceAsValue` is the string that the source conjugate to `FieldName` will format as.

To compute a spectrum use `ParticleSpectrum`:
```mathematica
ParticleSpectrum[
    Lagrangian_,
    TheoryName->TheoryNameValue_?String,
    Method->MethodValue_?String,
    MaxLaurentDepth->MaxLaurentDepthValue_
];
```
The arguments and options are as follows:
- `Lagrangian` must be a valid linearised Lagrangian density. The expression must be a Lorentz-scalar. Each term must be quadratic in the field(s) `FieldName` defined using `DefField`. Each term must be linear in coupling constants defined using `DefConstantSymbol` from _xTensor_. Other allowed ingredients are `CD` acting on field(s) `FieldName` and `G` used to contract indices. Do _not_ use an odd power of `epsilonG`, which will result in a parity-odd theory. Do _not_ include the term coupling the fields to their conjugate sources, this is automatically included.
- `TheoryNameValue` can be any string. This is used for labelling the output files.
- `MethodValue` can be either of the strings `"Easy"` (default) or `"Hard"` (experimental, uses home-brewed implementations of the symbolic Moore-Penrose inverse and other innovations).
- `MaxLaurentDepthValue` can be `1`, `2` or `3`. This sets the maximum positive integer $n$ for which the $1/k^{2n}$ null pole residues are requested. The default is `1`, from which the massless spectrum can be obtained. Setting higher $n$ naturally leads to longer runtimes, but also allows potential (pathological) higher-order/non-simple propagator poles to be identified, down to the requested depth.
